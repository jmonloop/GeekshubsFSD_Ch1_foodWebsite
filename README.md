# FSD Food-based Static Website Proyect
This is my second proyect in GeeksHubs Academy FSD bootcamp.
The requirements are to program a food-based static website using HTML5 and Bootstrap templates. 
The site must be responsive so it can be used with mobile devices.

A take-away food real business was chose so that functionalities can be added in the future as we advance in the backend and in the end achieve a totally functional and usable website.

In addition to Bootstrap, CSS has been used to make several adjustments. Also Javascript for change some Bootstrap animations.
